Description of programs:
1.a) Is an extention of the given code (from matrixSum.c) that also finds the
     value and position of the minimal and maximal elements in the matrix.
     This is done with two global structs with respective mutex's

1.b) Same result as 1.a) but implemented with pthread_join in main thread instead
     of barrier semantics. The idea of having an array with subsums has also been
     scrapped

1.c) Change of the task assignment from 1.b). Instead of static pre-defined areas
     for each worker the bag semantics is used

How to make:
    A makefile is provided in this directory with targets to build the original program
    (with the long to int edit), the assignements (a, b & c) and clean up the built
    executables (clean)

    All programs can be built with 'make all' and each individual version can be built
    by their individual targets (original, a, b & c).

How to run:
    A script to build and run the executables has been provided in this same 
    directory. To run all assignments simply run './run.sh'. After all assignments
    has been run the executables are cleand by 'make clean'

    Output will be formated by row, first which executable is run then it's output
    after a newline
