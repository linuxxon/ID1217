Changes done:
  Uncommenting 'rand()%99' causes overflow with ints so all sums are converted to
  longs insted

Description of programs:
    The variables min and max has been added and their updating is protected by the
    OpenMP construct critical which creates a critical section.


How to make:
    A makefile is provided in this directory with targets to build the program

    All programs can be built with 'make all' and each individual version can be built

How to run:
    A script to build and run the executables has been provided in this same 
    directory. To run all assignments simply run './run.sh'. After all assignments
    has been run the executables are cleand by 'make clean'

    Output will be formated by row, first which executable is run then it's output
    after a newline
