Description of programs:
    Palindrome is a program designed to find words that are palindromic. That means
    words that are palindroms, in other words, spells the same backwards as forwards.
    And words that are palindromic, if a word backwards becomes another word.

    The program is parallellized and has a specified top number of threads that can
    be run, which is 12 (as the KTH servers are 12 core machines).

    The execution flow of the program can be categorized as having three sections,
    the initialization, the examination and the clean up.

    The first part of the program is located inside the main function and loads the
    available dictionary into memory. The second part is parallellized using OpenMP.
    The interesting thing here is the choice of using dynamic scheduling instead of
    the default static scheduling. Despite the added overhead of dynamic scheduling
    it provides almost double performance per added core/thread.

    When all words have been checked, the total number of found palindroms are printed
    to standard out and the words are written to a textfile.
    
    The operativ part of the program is the check to see if the actual word is
    palindromic. This is done in two different checks, to see if the word is a palindrom
    and to see if the word backwards spells another word. The check is done by
    calling a function called 'is_palindrome' which takes two strings as arguments.
    If the words are equal in length the characters are checked for equality, one from
    the start of string one and the other from the end of string two. By calling 
    the function with the same string a palindrome can be detected.

How to make:
    A makefile is provided in this directory with targets to build the program.
    To enable debug printouts make the target 'debug'

How to run:
    A script to build and run the executables has been provided in this same 
    directory. To run all assignments simply run './run.sh'. After all assignments
    has been run the executables are cleand by 'make clean'

    To test the applications performace you can run the performance_test script that
    will also create a nice plot with the speedup per processor core.
