Description of programs:

How to make:
    A makefile is provided in this directory with targets to build the program
    with and without debugging enabled. Debugging texts include actions taken
    by the three threads.

    Building without debugging is done by executing 'make build' or simply
    'make'. With debugging, 'make debug'

How to run:
    A script to build and run a test is povided in this same directory.
    The "test" would execute the program with a text file as input, after
    printing the very same, showing the standard ouput from execution then
    printing the contents of the file with the filename entered as an
    argument to tee.

    Running tee is usually done in the following manner:
        <program> | tee [filename] [ | <program> ]

    The test runs tee with the text file as standard input, as follows
        tee test.outfile < text > test.stdout

    The result is determined by comparing standard output and the outfile to
    the text file input with the cmp program.

    After the test is complete the
    result is printed to standard output and the files are removed.
