Description of programs:
    The goal of the program is to print out lines that differ between two
    files. This is a simple implementation that prints the name of the file
    and the linenumber for each line that differs.

    If one file is longer than the other all the remaining lines are printed

    The structure of the implementation is based on two syncronous cyclic
    buffers and three threads working concurrently with them.

    The two producers will add lines from their files to their respective
    buffers until reaching EOF whereby incrementing the global variable
    'done' indicating both files are done when the variable takes on the
    value 2.

    When there are lines in both buffers a third thread compares the lines
    and prints them if the they differ. After one file finnishes the consumer
    will print the remaining lines of the other file regardless.

    Each time new data is deposited into the buffer, the conditional variable
    'buff_empty' is signaled with a broadcast to wake any consumers waiting
    for more data. After each individual consumption from the buffer
    'buff_full' is signaled in case a slot in the buffer has been freed.

How to make:
    A makefile is provided in this directory with targets to build the program
    with and without debugging enabled. Debugging texts include actions taken
    by the three threads.

    Building without debugging is done by executing 'make build' or simply
    'make'. With debugging, 'make debug'

How to run:
    Running diff is done as follows
        diff file1 file 2

    A script that build and run a test is provided in this same directory.
    Diff is run with two files provided with minor differences and different
    lengths.
